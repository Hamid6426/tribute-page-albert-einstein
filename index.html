          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a theoretical physicist whose work
            fundamentally changed the way we understand the universe. Best known
            for the theory of relativity and his equation
            <strong>E=mc<sup>2</sup></strong
            >, Einstein's intellectual contributions extended beyond physics
            into philosophy and humanitarianism.

            </li>
            <li>
              Graduated in 1900, faced challenges finding a job in academia,
              leading to a position at the Swiss Patent Office.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Breakthroughs:</h3>
          <p>
            In 1905, known as his "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year), Einstein
            published four groundbreaking papers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Photoelectric Effect:</strong> Established the particle
              theory of light, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Brownian Motion:</strong> Provided empirical evidence for
              the existence of atoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special Theory of Relativity:</strong> Introduced
              revolutionary concepts of space and time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mass-Energy Equivalence:</strong> Formulated the famous
              equation <strong>E=mc<sup>2</sup></strong
              >.
            </li>

              quantum theory.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>General Theory of Relativity (1915):</strong> Proposed a
              new understanding of gravity, describing it as the curvature of
              spacetime caused by mass.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Influence on Quantum Mechanics:</strong> Although critical
